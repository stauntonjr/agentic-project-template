# Changelog

All notable changes to the harness are recorded here. The harness version and a derived project's product version are independent release streams.

## [0.4.1] - Unreleased

### Fixed

- Live GitHub planning audit now works with supported GitHub CLI versions that do not
  provide `gh api --slurp`, while retaining zero-, single-, and multi-page JSON parsing.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Provider-neutral roles, skills, engineering loop, evidence reports, intake, GitHub planning, and project profiles.
- Codex and experimental Pi adapters.
- Integrity-checked write scopes, independent verifier verdicts, and provenance-locked harness upgrades.
- Configurable product-version, engineering-quality, and GitHub security contracts.
- Dependabot, dependency review, CodeQL, and immutable GitHub Actions validation.

### Security

- Completion fingerprints worktree, index, hidden index flags, submodules, and embedded repositories.
- Third-party GitHub Actions are pinned to reviewed full commit SHAs.
