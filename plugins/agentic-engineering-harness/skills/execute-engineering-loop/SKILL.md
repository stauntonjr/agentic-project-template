description: Run a non-trivial repository change through intake, evidence gathering, planning, authorization, implementation, independent verification, integration, reporting, and learning. Use for features, defects, refactors, migrations, or documentation changes that alter durable project state; do not use for a read-only answer.

# Execute engineering loop

Read `harness/loops/engineering-loop.yaml` and the relevant role contracts before acting.

## Start

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, `harness/project.yaml`, the handoff, governing Issue, and linked ADRs.
2. Inspect Git status and resolve the exact branch/worktree boundary.
3. Assess context readiness: do you have enough intent, evidence, authority, acceptance criteria, and current-state knowledge to excel? Inspect discoverable facts first. Ask focused follow-ups only for material gaps; record safe assumptions.
4. Invoke `$agentic-engineering-harness:research-existing-solutions` when novelty, standards, licensing, current external behavior, or buy-versus-build materially affects the plan.
5. Start the evidence boundary:

   ```bash
   python3 tools/loop.py start --issue NUMBER \
     --objective "ACCEPTED OBJECTIVE" \
     --criterion "AC1=MECHANICALLY VERIFIABLE RESULT" \
     --write-path path/to/exact-file \
     --write-prefix path/to/owned-directory \
     --implementer PROVIDER/SESSION-ID
   ```

Do not invent a start commit or dirty baseline after implementation begins. The baseline binds worktree content, staged index identity, and dirty gitlinks. Use stable criterion IDs. Declare exact files with `--write-path` and directory subtrees with `--write-prefix`; never use the repository root as a catch-all.

## Execute the states

Follow the state order and gates in the loop contract.

- Keep the orchestrator as sole owner of shared Git lifecycle, integration, and GitHub planning state.
- Delegate only independent, bounded lanes. Use one write-capable owner per worktree.
- Give every implementer an issue, branch, worktree, path scope, acceptance evidence, and stop condition.
- Use a verifier who did not author the reviewed work.
- Stop after three consecutive failures at the same boundary and escalate with preserved evidence.
- Obtain required human approval before external side effects.
- Treat a failed network or loopback probe inside a restricted runtime as indeterminate, not as
  proof that a credential, API, container, or host service is unavailable. Before classifying a
  local service outage, use the approved host-permission path to inspect its supervisor, candidate
  container/process, listener, and health or discovery endpoint. If host verification is not
  available, report the boundary as unverified. Inspect before starting or restarting a workload;
  never launch a possible duplicate first, especially for GPU- or port-exclusive services.

Record exact checks as they finish:

```bash
python3 tools/loop.py record-check --run RUN_ID --name NAME \
  --command "EXACT COMMAND" --status passed --evidence "BOUNDARY PROVEN" \
  --criterion AC1
```

Before independent approval, record the recommended product release impact. Base it on the public compatibility contract in `harness/project.yaml`, not commit-message syntax:

```bash
python3 tools/loop.py record-release-impact --run RUN_ID \
  --level patch --reason "SEMANTIC COMPATIBILITY RATIONALE" \
  --public-contract-change "OPTIONAL CHANGED CONTRACT"
```

Use `none`, `patch`, `minor`, or `major`. `none` means the project contract does not require a product release for this change. This assessment is a recommendation and never authorizes a version bump or publication.

If objective, acceptance, or write scope changes, use `loop.py revise`; if implementation retries without changing the contract, use `loop.py new-attempt`. Prior checks and approvals do not satisfy the new revision or attempt, and a contract revision invalidates prior criterion waivers. `new-attempt` persists each failure and blocks after the third without creating attempt four.

Inspect a preserved run without changing Git state:

```bash
python3 tools/loop.py recovery-status --run RUN_ID --integration-ref main
```

After retry exhaustion, do not delete partial work or continue under a fourth attempt. Prepare a
structured handoff containing `schema_version`, `summary`, `failure_boundary`, `preserved_paths`,
and `next_action`. Only a human-reviewed resume starts a new revision:

```bash
python3 tools/loop.py resume --run RUN_ID --handoff /path/to/handoff.json \
  --by human:IDENTITY
```

The `human:` marker is auditable provenance, not authentication. Resume preserves the working tree,
returns to `understand`, and invalidates the old revision's checks, waivers, impact, and verdict.

After verification, the independent reviewer records a verdict:

```bash
python3 tools/loop.py record-verdict --run RUN_ID \
  --reviewer PROVIDER/SEPARATE-SESSION-ID --verdict approve \
  --criterion AC1 --evidence "RAW REVIEW EVIDENCE"
```

The reviewer identity must differ from every recorded implementer. The approval is bound to the current revision, attempt, commit, and baseline-relative working-tree digest.

Only an explicit human decision may waive a criterion. Record its provenance and rationale with `loop.py waive-criterion --criterion AC1 --by human:IDENTITY --reason "..."`; the label is auditable evidence, not authentication.

Use `references/handoff-contract.md` for every agent handoff.

## Finish

1. Reconcile implementation, tests, docs, ADRs, handoff, Issue, and Project state.
2. Run `make smoke`, `git diff --check`, and `git status --short`.
3. Invoke `$agentic-engineering-harness:loop-report` or run `python3 tools/loop.py finish --run RUN_ID`. A `reported` finish refuses missing criterion evidence, missing or stale release impact, stale or non-independent approval, and writes outside the declared scope. Use `--state blocked` or `--state abandoned` to preserve an incomplete run truthfully.
4. In Learn, inspect every failed command, rejected approach, retry, and human correction. For a
   repeatable failure, add a sanitized entry to `docs/project/correction-log.md` containing the
   failed path, short error signature, mutation status, corrected path, verification, and durable
   prevention surface. Preserve the original failure even after correction. Never retain secrets,
   raw transcripts, private prompts, or hidden reasoning.
5. Convert deterministic escaped defects into challenge candidates when possible. Use a skill,
   test, or tool guard for command-routing mistakes that cannot be replayed safely without live
   side effects. Do not apply policy changes without human review.

A loop is not complete because code exists. It is complete only when the accepted boundary is verified, independently reviewed where required, reconciled, and reported.
